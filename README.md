Snabbdom Experiment
===

Just an experiment with getting [snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom) up and running for frontend web dev.

Tools
---

Why are there so many effin' js tools, and why does each have like 100s of dependencies??

* yarn: node package management
* browserify: create bundles
* typescript: better javascript?
