Snabbdom Experiment
===

Just an experiment with getting [snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom) up and running for frontend web dev.

Usage
---

Hot reloading js: `yarn run hot`

* Uses yarn to run the `hot` script in package.json
    * Uses gulp to run the `hot` task in gulpfile.js
        * Configures and runs hot-reloading browserify+watchify with sourcemaps :)
            * outputs js to `./build/bundle.js`

Building js: `./node_modules/.bin/browserify --debug main.js > build/bundle.js`

Cutting versions:

* `yarn version` (interactive)

Tools
---

Why are there so many effin' js tools, and why does each have like 100s of dependencies??

* yarn: node package management
* browserify: create bundles
* typescript: better javascript?
